# RoomDB

The Room persistence library provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow fluent database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.

The library helps you create a cache of your app's data on a device that's running your app. This cache, which serves as your app's single source of truth, allows users to view a consistent copy of key information within your app, regardless of whether users have an internet connection.

To import Room into your Android project, see adding components to your project.

For a guide on applying Room's capabilities to your app's data storage persistence solution, see the Room training guide.
